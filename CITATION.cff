title: "Geometric Interpretability: Understanding Neural Networks through Boundary Analysis"
abstract: "A framework for understanding neural networks through spatial structure rather than semantic content. We propose Geometric Boundary Analysis (GBA) for detecting knowledge boundaries in activation space. Applying GBA to Mistral-7B, we discover that training produces remarkably structured representations: boundaries exhibit 0.3% curvature deviation from perfect linearity, 1.000 symmetry ratio between classes, and 148Ã— information concentration in a single dimension. In a grokking experiment on modular arithmetic, we find that class separation correlates more strongly with generalization (r=0.910, p<0.0001) than boundary sharpness (r=-0.651). We demonstrate distance-based epistemic routing achieving 96.5% hallucination detection with multi-layer consensus, 98.6% accuracy in balanced mode, and perfect accuracy (100%) in high-stakes mode with zero false positives. The method requires only 30-second setup, <1ms inference overhead, and no model retraining."
